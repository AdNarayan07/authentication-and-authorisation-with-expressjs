## How to run

Using `python3`, you can run a live server by running the following command at the **root of the `web-front-end` directory**.

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

This will run a live server at the URL http://0.0.0.0:8000 or http://127.0.0.1:8000. Sometimes, VSCode by default does a Port redirect which you can see at **Ports tab** i.e. http://localhost:8001.

Make sure the backend is running. Instructions to run the backend is located at the `back-end` directory's `README.md`.
